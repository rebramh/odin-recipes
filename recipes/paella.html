    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloces garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
        <li>4 ounces Spanish chorizo, casing discarded and cut into 1/4 inch dice</li>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) package uncooked Arborio rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Heat olive oil in paella pan over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, and pepper; cook and stir for a few minutes. Add chorizo sausage, diced chicken, and rice; cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in 3 ½ cups stock, wine, thyme leaves, and saffron. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, and simmer for 15 minutes; stir occasionally.</p>
   
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Taste the rice, and check to see if it is cooked. If the rice is uncooked, stir in ½ cup more stock. Continue cooking, stirring occasionally. Stir in additional stock if necessary: use up to 2 cups additional stock, 5 cups total. Cook until rice is done.</p>
    
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Stir in squid, tomatoes, and peas. Cook for 2 minutes. Arrange prawns and mussels on top. Cover with foil, and leave for 3 to 5 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Remove the foil, and scatter parsley over the food. Serve in paella pan, garnished with lemon wedges.</p>
